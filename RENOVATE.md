# Renovate

This repository contains the following shared configurations for Renovate, a tool to automate dependency updates which
would be available as a [shareable preset](https://docs.renovatebot.com/config-presets/).
- A default `renovate-config.json` file for general use in all repositories.
- A `renovate-config-security-updates-only.json` file for use in Laminas repositories marked "security-updates-only".

## Default Configuration

By calling the file `renovate-config.json` and placing it in this repository, we can take advantage of Renovate
detecting this, allowing easy
[onboarding](https://docs.renovatebot.com/getting-started/installing-onboarding/#repository-onboarding) for
repositories.

### Goals

The default configuration has the following goals for a shared preset:

- a single PR for anything non-major that doesn't fit the current version constraints. (e.g. coding standards)
- a PR for any new majors grouped by org.
- otherwise, the lockfile is updated and automatically merged once tests pass, opening a PR only if those fail.

### Next steps for downstream maintainers

Once the Mend Renovate GitHub app is enabled for a repository, a new `Configure Renovate` PR will be opened
containing a basic `renovate.json` file with the following contents:

```json
{
    "extends": [
        "local>laminas/.github:renovate-config"
    ]
}
```

In order to be fully compatible with this Renovate configuration, you must ensure the following criteria are met:
1. CI actions are enabled for `push` events on branches with the prefix `renovate/*`.
2. The lockfile must have been generated using Composer with a version `>=2.2`.
3. Lastly, for Renovate to detect the correct version of PHP to use for lockfile maintenance, the PHP version must be
   set in `composer.json` under the key [`config.platform.php`](https://getcomposer.org/doc/06-config.md#platform).

### Presets

Using primarily the inbuilt shared presets, this allows us to somewhat overcome the need to upgrade our configuration as
often when Renovate updates a major version. Take for example: `":automergeDisabled"`, this will add the configuration
`"automerge": false`. Should Renovate update this in a major version bump, they will also update the preset. So where
possible presets have been chosen.

```json
"extends": [
    ":dependencyDashboard",
    ":ignoreModulesAndTests",
    ":automergeMinor",
    ":automergeBranch",
    ":prNotPending",
    ":rebaseStalePrs",
    ":semanticCommitsDisabled",
    ":separateMajorReleases",
    ":combinePatchMinorReleases",
    ":enableVulnerabilityAlerts",
    ":timezone(UTC)",
    ":gitSignOff",
    ":label(renovate)",
    "group:allNonMajor"
],
```

- **[:dependencyDashboard](https://docs.renovatebot.com/presets-default/#dependencydashboard)** - This will open a
persistent issue in each repository to allow easy tracking of all Renovate updates.
- **[:ignoreModulesAndTests](https://docs.renovatebot.com/presets-default/#ignoremodulesandtests)** - This ensures
Renovate does not try to update `composer.json` inside `tests/`, `vendor/` etc.
- **[:automergeMinor](https://docs.renovatebot.com/presets-default/#automergeminor)** - Automatically merge non-major
updates of updates by default.
- **[:automergeBranch](https://docs.renovatebot.com/presets-default/#automergebranch)** - But set the default automatic
merge type to be `branch` meaning a PR is only opened on failure.
- **[:prNotPending](https://docs.renovatebot.com/presets-default/#prnotpending)** - PRs will also only be created AFTER
all checks have finished running.
- **[:rebaseStalePrs](https://docs.renovatebot.com/presets-default/#rebasestaleprs)** - Any PRs previously opened by
Renovate will be automatically rebased should they fall behind.
- **[:semanticCommitsDisabled](https://docs.renovatebot.com/presets-default/#semanticcommitsdisabled)** - Disable semantic
prefixes for commit messages and PR titles.
- **[:separateMajorReleases](https://docs.renovatebot.com/presets-default/#separatemajorreleases)** - Any new major
releases for a package will be separated into its own update.
- **[:combinePatchMinorReleases](https://docs.renovatebot.com/presets-default/#combinepatchminorreleases)** - Patch and
minor releases for a single package will be combined to a single update.
- **[:enableVulnerabilityAlerts](https://docs.renovatebot.com/presets-default/#enablevulnerabilityalerts)** - Open a PR
should the repository have any vulnerability alerts (see below).
- **[:timezone(UTC)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/presets-default/#timezonearg0)** - Not strictly necessary but ensures
schedules use the UTC timezone.
- **[:gitSignOff](https://docs.renovatebot.com/presets-default/#gitsignoff)** - DCO requires all commits to be signed off.
- **[:label(renovate)](https://docs.renovatebot.com/presets-default/#labelarg0)** - Add the label `renovate` to any PRs.
- **[group:allNonMajor](https://docs.renovatebot.com/presets-group/#groupallnonmajor)** - Any non-major updates will be
grouped into a single update.

#### Vulnerability Alerts

From https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#vulnerabilityalerts:

> Renovate can read from GitHub's Vulnerability Alerts and customize Pull Requests accordingly. For this to work, you
> must first ensure you have enabled "Dependency graph" and "Dependabot alerts" under the "Security & analysis" section
> of the repository's "Settings" tab.
>
> Additionally, if you are running Renovate in app mode then you must make sure that the app has been granted the
> permissions to read "Vulnerability alerts". If you are the account admin, browse to the app (e.g.
> https://github.com/apps/renovate), select "Configure", and then scroll down to the "Permissions" section and verify
> that read access to "vulnerability alerts" is mentioned.
>
> Once the above conditions are met, and you have received one or more vulnerability alerts from GitHub for this
> repository, then Renovate will attempt to raise fix PRs accordingly.

### Other Settings

```json
"commitBodyTable": true,
"enabledManagers": ["composer", "dockerfile", "docker-compose", "github-actions"],
"lockFileMaintenance": {"enabled": true, "extends": ["schedule:daily"]},
"platformAutomerge": true,
"prFooter": "[Read more information](https://github.com/laminas/.github/blob/main/RENOVATE.md) about the use of [Renovate Bot](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) within Laminas.",
"rangeStrategy": "replace",
"rollbackPrs": true,
"vulnerabilityAlerts": {"rangeStrategy": "bump"}
```

- **[commitBodyTable](https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#commitbodytable)** - Adds a table to the commit
message describing all updates in the commit.
- **[enabledManagers](https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#enabledmanagers)** - To begin with, this is
enabled for `composer`, `dockerfile`, `docker-compose` and `github-actions`. Other managers (such as `npm` etc) are also
available.
- **[lockFileMaintenance](https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#lockfilemaintenance)** - Lockfile
maintenance should be performed during the scheduled run.
- **[platformAutomerge](https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#platformautomerge)** - Use GitHub's merging
features, falling back to Renovate's own merging methods.
- **[prFooter](https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#prfooter)** - The text here will be set as the footer
to any PR opened by Renovate. 
- **[rangeStrategy](https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#rangestrategy)** - Setting this to `replace`
ensures that PRs are only created once the new release falls outside the version constraints inside `composer.json`.
- **[rollbackPrs](https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#rollbackprs)** - A rare occurrence, but should a
package become revoked, a PR to downgrade the package will be created.
- **[vulnerabilityAlerts](https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#vulnerabilityalerts)** - Vulnerability alerts, enabled by a previous preset, will use a `rangeStrategy` of `update-lockfile` by default. This ensures that `composer.json` files are updated also.

### Package Rules

```json
"packageRules": [
    {"matchDepTypes": ["require"], "rangeStrategy": "widen"},
    {"matchPackagePatterns": ["^laminas/"], "groupSlug": "laminas", "groupName": "all Laminas packages"},
    {"matchPackagePatterns": ["^laminas-api-tools/"], "groupSlug": "laminas-api-tools", "groupName": "all Laminas API Tools packages"},
    {"matchPackagePatterns": ["^mezzio/"], "groupSlug": "mezzio", "groupName": "all Mezzio packages"}
]
```

The first of these package rules will ensure that non-development dependency version constraints are widened when a
newer version is available outside them. Widening the range of a development dependency makes little sense.
 - `replace` Replace the range with a newer one if the new version falls outside it, and update nothing otherwise.
 - `widen` Widen the range with newer one, e.g. `^1.0.0` -> `^1.0.0 || ^2.0.0`.

Although not necessary, this will group updates from each of these organizations into a single update. Combined with the
rules from above, this will usually only occur for new major releases.

## Security Updates Only Configuration

Extending the default, the file `renovate-config-security-updates-only.json` is made specifically for use in Laminas
repositories that have been marked as receiving "security-updates-only".

### Presets

```json
"extends": [
   "local>laminas/.github:renovate-config",
   ":maintainLockFilesDisabled"
],
```

- **local>laminas/.github:renovate-config** - As stated, the first preset extends the default configuration described
above.
- **[:maintainLockFilesDisabled](https://docs.renovatebot.com/presets-default/#maintainlockfilesdisabled)** - Only
update lock files when `composer.json` is updated.

### Package Rules

```json
"packageRules": [
   {"matchPackagePatterns": ["*"], "enabled": false},
   {"matchPackageNames": ["php"], "enabled": true, "rangeStrategy": "widen"}
]
```

The first rule will disable all updates that aren't lockfile maintenance (disabled above) or vulnerability alerts
(which we want to keep). Then with the second rule, support for new versions of PHP will be added and merged if all
checks pass, or a PR raised if any fail.
